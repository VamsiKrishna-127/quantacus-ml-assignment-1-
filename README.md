## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize the performance of an email marketing campaign for an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques. The campaignâ€™s effectiveness is measured by how many users open the email and, more importantly, click on the link inside it.

## Tools and Libraries Used
 
- Pandas for data manipulation  
- NumPy for numerical operations  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- XGBoost or LightGBM for gradient boosting (if used)  
- Joblib or Pickle for model saving (if applicable)    

## Approach and Methodology

The solution was developed in the following phases:

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Loaded the dataset and examined structure, data types, and null values  
- Generated summary statistics  
- Visualized key relationships and distributions to guide preprocessing  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Treated missing values and outliers where necessary  
- Applied encoding to categorical variables using label or one-hot encoding  
- Scaled or normalized features for better model performance  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Identified the most relevant features based on domain knowledge and correlation  
- Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection where appropriate  

### 4. Model Selection and Training  
- Built and evaluated baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV  

### 5. Model Evaluation  
- Assessed performance using multiple evaluation metrics:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC  
- Used confusion matrix and classification report to visualize results
