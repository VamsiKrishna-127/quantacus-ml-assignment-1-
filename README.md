## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize the performance of an email marketing campaign for an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques. The campaignâ€™s effectiveness is measured by how many users open the email and, more importantly, click on the link inside it.

## Tools and Libraries Used
 
- Pandas for data manipulation  
- NumPy for numerical operations  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  
- XGBoost or LightGBM for gradient boosting (if used)  
- Joblib or Pickle for model saving (if applicable)    

## Approach and Methodology

The solution was developed in the following phases:

### 1. Data Exploration  
- Loaded the dataset and examined structure, data types, and null values  
- Generated summary statistics  
- Visualized key relationships and distributions to guide preprocessing  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Treated missing values and outliers where necessary  
- Applied encoding to categorical variables using label or one-hot encoding  
- Scaled or normalized features for better model performance  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Identified the most relevant features based on domain knowledge and correlation  
- Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection where appropriate  

### 4. Model Selection and Training  
- Built and evaluated baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV  

### 5. Model Evaluation  
- Assessed performance using multiple evaluation metrics:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC  
- Used confusion matrix and classification report to visualize results

## Insights forgiven project

- The email should be sent to the user in between 20 to 25 hour range so it has a peak concentration on emails by the users.
- Friday and Saturday weekdays has the low rate of clicking link and opening the emails so we can ignore these two weekdays and focus on other weekdays while sending the emails to the users.
- Personalised emails are step forward than the general emails so personalised make a bit of related connexion for the user and the company so mostly prefer personalised mails.
- As a short email gave a good results in Then the long mail so prefer using short emails with a in brief content so that the user cannot waste all the time by reading long mails the email should be sweet and short so he can understand the exact concept that you are delivering
- The clients from UK and US are showing more interest on the company these two countries have the high link leaked rate and email opened
- The purchase history of the users also impacts the emails Open and linked clicked
